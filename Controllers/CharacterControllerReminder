CharacterController is supposed to be an all purpose controller. It is designed to work for both players and AI. 
PhysicsController is an extension of CharacterController that uses Force commands in Unity's built in Physics system to control movement and rotation.


In order for the Controller to work, it must be accompanied by 1) an AgentType and 2) an InputModel.
